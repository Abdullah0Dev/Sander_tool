I have a relatively small Instagram growth company called powergram, more info can be found on www.powergram.nl. I use different online tools and automation on phones on the official Instagram app to grow clients Instagram pages.
The way the service works. The client gives a list of Instagram usernames they think are similar to their own or their competitors. We then use the software to automate their growth by interacting with the followers or likers of these pages.
The problem  :



the problem I am running into is that often the information provided from the client is very bad and we have to do the research ourselves which is very time consuming.
The way we currently do it is manual by following the client profile and registering the suggestions Instagram provide (this pops up when you follow them).
Solution:
There are some scraping tools out there that can scrape data and filter them off Instagram pretty quickly and not so expensive https://parser.im/ for example.
But there is some cheap API tools out there, which allow you to do your own scraping.
HikerAPI
Graph api wrapper
But not the functionality I need. A competitor of mine showed me he uses a scrypt that he made.
He enters the client username: and it finds a (big list) of similar profiles with a API call for related profiles and then uses a API call to pull extended information. Basically giving me the information I would need for running my service and filtering them on quality.
The idea is to create such a tool to use internally to help me do my job in a web interface and also add some basic scraping functionality on the HikerAPI. Like getting the usernames of followers for example.
Maybe you have a idea to filter based on quality or AI integration?
Let me know your thoughts
